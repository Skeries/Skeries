# Insurance Claim Appeal Letter

**To:** Claims Review Department  
**Insurance Company:** [Insurance Carrier Name]  
**Policy Number:** [Policy Number]  
**Claim Number:** [Claim Number]  
**Date:** [Date]

Dear Claims Review Specialist,

I represent **[Client Full Name]**, the policyholder named above, regarding the denial of coverage issued on [denial date]. After carefully reviewing the policy provisions, the claim file, and the stated reasons for denial, we dispute the decision and request that the claim be approved and paid without further delay. Our position is supported by the following points.

## 1. Factual Background

1. On [loss date], the covered loss occurred when [brief description of incident].
2. The client promptly notified the carrier on [notification date] and cooperated fully with all requests for information, inspections, and documentation.
3. All required forms, invoices, and supporting records were submitted on [submission date], confirming the nature and value of the loss.

## 2. Policy Coverage

* The policy's **[relevant coverage section]** provides indemnity for losses arising from [covered peril or situation].
* The definitions in Section [section number] clarify that [cite definition] encompasses the event experienced by our client.
* No exclusions apply. Specifically, exclusion [exclusion reference] requires [conditions], which are absent here. The claim denial letter did not identify any applicable exclusion, and the facts do not support one.

## 3. Compliance With Policy Conditions

* **Prompt Notice:** Notice was given within [number] days, well inside the policy's "prompt notice" requirement.
* **Mitigation:** The client mitigated damages by [mitigation steps], as documented in the enclosed receipts and photographs.
* **Documentation:** We supplied all documents requested by the adjuster, including [list]. The denial letter acknowledges receipt of these materials.

## 4. Rebuttal to Denial Rationale

The denial relies on [summarize rationale]. However:

1. The adjuster's conclusion that [denial reason] conflicts with the independent expert report dated [date], which confirms [supporting conclusion].
2. Photographs taken immediately after the loss show [key evidence], demonstrating that the damage resulted directly from the covered event.
3. The policy's exclusion for [exclusion topic] requires intentional or long-term damage. The evidence shows the loss was sudden and accidental.

Given these facts, the denial rests on an incorrect interpretation of the policy and a disregard of the evidence on file.

## 5. Requested Action

We request that the insurer:

1. Reverse the denial decision.  
2. Issue payment of **$[amount]** representing the covered loss, plus any applicable interest.
3. Confirm in writing within fifteen (15) days that the claim has been reinstated for payment.

## 6. Preservation of Rights

This letter should be treated as a formal appeal and demand for coverage. If the carrier maintains its denial, please provide a detailed explanation citing all policy provisions and evidence relied upon. We reserve all rights and remedies available under the policy, state law, and applicable regulations.

Please acknowledge receipt of this appeal within five (5) business days. If you require additional information, contact me at [phone number] or [email address].

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter.

Sincerely,
