## Description
Microsoft Security Advisory CVE-2020-0605: .NET Framework Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### Executive Summary
A remote code execution vulnerability exists in .NET software when the software fails to check the source markup of a file.

An attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of the current user. If the current user is logged on with administrative user rights, an attacker could take control of the affected system. An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted than users who operate with administrative user rights.

Exploitation of the vulnerability requires that a user open a specially crafted file with an affected version of .NET Framework. In an email attack scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially crafted file to the user and convincing the user to open the file.

The security update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how .NET Framework checks the source markup of a file.

## Advisory FAQ

### How do I know if I am affected?
If all of the following are true:

- Run `pwsh -v`, then, check the version in the table in Affected Software to see if your version of PowerShell is affected.
- If you are running a version of PowerShell where the executable is not `pwsh` or `pwsh.exe`, then you are affected. This only existed for preview version of 7.0.

### How do I update to an unaffected version?
Follow the instructions at Installing PowerShell to install the latest version of PowerShell.
