Summary
When Get-Help is invoked with no flags or with -Detailed it includes a REMARKS section recommending re-trying Get-Help with -Examples, -Detailed, -Full, or -Online. Please also recommend -Parameter <paramName>.

Example suggested wording:
"For interactive help, also try: -Examples, -Detailed, -Full, -Online, or -Parameter <paramName> (e.g. Get-Help <Cmdlet> -Parameter Name)."

Rationale
Many users find parameter-level help especially useful and sometimes try to remember whether the switch is Param/Params/Parameter. Adding -Parameter to the generated REMARKS is a low-effort UX improvement that reduces confusion and improves discoverability.

Implementation notes
The change is mostly a presentation tweak to the help generator. If -Parameter is not currently supported in all help modes, the issue should request that the generator either add the text only where the parameter help is available or ensure -Parameter content is produced for the same modes that show the REMARKS hint.

I'd be happy to help draft a small PR for the docs generator if maintainers want it.
